This folder contains the data from the 2022 Science Advances paper on in-situ deep-sea mining experiments, Munoz-Royo et al.

## **Instrumentation on the collector**

- 10 optic STM turbidity sensors 
    - 5 on front at heights of 1, 1.6, 2, 2.5, 3.2m
    - 4 across top
    - 1 at rear near discharge vents
    - Sampled at 1Hz
- Internal pressure sensors and concentration sensor inside ducts of collector to measure water flow rate and sediment concentration before discharge 
    - used to measure sediment mass flux, initial conditions

## **Fixed instrumentation mooring**

- MA
    - 6 STM at heights of  2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 6.2, 7.2, 8.2m
    - Thermistors from 2.5m to 61.7m 
    - two ADCP ~17m above seabed, one up one down

- MC 
    - 3 STM at 1.9, 2.6, 4.6m
    - two ADCP ~17m above seabed, one up one down

________

### **drive-by experiment**

_Collector vehicle drives in a straight track passing at a minimum distance D from an instrumented mooring_

DB1 - Two of the four collection pumps at 50% flow rate
 
________

### **ACDP**

_Acoustic doppler current profiler (measures current velocities over depth range)_

- One looking down, one up, 17m off seabed
- Recorded current velocity between 7-10m above seabed
    - Couldn't go lower becuase of reflections off things nearer seabed

________

### **selfie experiment**

_To investigate the sediment plume in the wake of the vehicle. Vehicle drove for ~100m collecting nodules, turned off collector, then did 3 x 90&deg; turns and drove through the collector plume perpendicularly across the track. Each selfie ecountered the plume at an earlier time in its life cycle than the previous._

- Photo taken at intervals through the selfie
- Vertical sediment concentration profile taken using 'Seapoint Turbidity Meter'

A1 - Two of the four collection pumps at 50% flow rate

B1 - Collection system turned off
